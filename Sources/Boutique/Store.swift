/// A fancy persistence layer.
///
/// A ``Store`` for your app which provides you a dual-layered data architecture with a very simple API.
/// The ``Store`` exposes a `@Published` property for your data, which allows you to read it's data synchronously
/// using `store.items`, or subscribe to `store.$items` reactively for real-time changes and updates.
///
/// Under the hood the ``Store`` is doing the work of saving all changes to a persistence layer
/// when you insert or remove items, which allows you to build an offline-first app
/// for free, all inclusive, *no extra code required*.
///
/// **How The Store Works**
///
/// A ``Store`` is a higher level abstraction than Bodega's `ObjectStorage`, containing and leveraging
/// an in-memory store, the ``items`` array, and a `StorageEngine` for it's persistence layer.
///
/// The `StorageEngine` you initialize a ``Store`` with (such as `DiskStorageEngine` or `SQLiteStorageEngine`)
/// will be where items are stored permanently. If you do not provide a `StorageEngine` parameter
/// then the ``Store`` will default to using an Bodega's SQLiteStorageEngine with a database
/// located in the app's `defaultStorageDirectory`, in a "Data" subdirectory.
///
/// As a user you will always be interacting with the ``Store``s memory layer,
/// represented by the ``Store``'s array of ``items``. This means after initializing a ``Store``
/// with a `StorageEngine` you never have to think about how the data is being saved.
///
/// The `SQLiteStorageEngine` is a safe, fast, and easy database to based on SQLite, a great default!
///
/// **If you prefer to use your own persistence layer or want to save your items
/// to another location, you can use the `storage` parameter like so**
/// ```
/// SQLiteStorageEngine(directory: .documents(appendingPath: "Assets"))
/// ```
///
/// **How Cache Identifiers Work**
///
/// The `cacheIdentifier` generates a unique `String` representing a key for storing
/// your item in the underlying persistence layer (the `StorageEngine`).
///
/// The `cacheIdentifier` is `KeyPath` rather than a `String`, a good strategy for generating
/// a stable and unique `cacheIdentifier` is to conform to `Identifiable` and point to `\.id`.
/// That is *not* required though, and you are free to use any `String` property on your `Item`
/// or even a type which can be converted into a `String` such as `\.url.path`.
